# Known Limitations

This document outlines the current limitations of this ad server implementation. 

## Critical Limitations

### Horizontal Scaling Limitations
- **Single-Instance Architecture**: 
  - All campaign/line item data loaded into memory of single server instance
  - No distributed data store for campaign configuration
  - Redis used only for operational counters (frequency caps, pacing)
  - Impact: Cannot scale beyond single server for campaign data
- **Memory constraints**: Campaign data limited by available server RAM
- **No distributed state**: Multiple instances would serve inconsistent campaigns

### Security & Production Readiness
- **Limited authentication framework**: HMAC token system provides basic security but lacks full OAuth/JWT framework
- **No audit logging**: Changes to campaigns/line items are not tracked
- **Unauthenticated admin endpoints**: CRUD operations have no access control
- **No user management**: No roles, permissions, or multi-user support

## Performance & Scalability Limitations

### Request Processing
- **Synchronous ad selection**: No async processing, blocks on database lookups
- **Creative scanning**: O(1) placement lookup but O(n) filtering within placements
- **Memory allocation**: Heavy use of slices and maps without pooling

### Database Performance
- **Campaign data reloads**:
  - Full table scans: Campaign reloads fetch all records (no incremental updates)
  - Blocking reloads: 30-second reload cycles can block request processing
  - Manual reload required: Configuration changes need `/reload` endpoint call

### External Dependencies
- **ClickHouse bottleneck**: Analytics writes not buffered, can block serving
- **CTR prediction timeout**: 100ms timeout may be too aggressive under load
- **Prebid timeout constraints**: 800ms programmatic bid timeout may cause timeouts

## Technical Debt & Architecture

- **Tight coupling**: Database, analytics, and serving logic are interdependent
- **Error handling**: Many error scenarios result in 500s rather than graceful degradation
- **Limited targeting**: Geo-targeting limited to country/region (no city/DMA)
- **No user segments**: Cannot target based on user behavioral data
- **No alerting**: No built-in alerting for system health or performance issues
- **Basic log sampling**: Fixed environment-based sampling may not suit all traffic patterns

## Management & Operations

- **Basic admin UI only**: Includes development admin interface but not suitable for production use
- **No campaign workflow**: No approval process, creative review, or campaign lifecycle management
- **Limited reporting**: No real-time dashboards or custom report generation
- **No billing system**: No invoicing, payment processing, or financial reporting
- **Manual operations**: No backup/restore, disaster recovery, or automated maintenance
- **No publisher onboarding**: No self-service registration or account management

## Feature Gaps vs. Commercial Ad Servers

### Advanced Targeting
- **No audience targeting**: Cannot target based on user demographics or interests
- **Limited frequency capping**: Simple impression-based only, no time-window sophistication
- **Missing brand safety**: No content categorization or blocking capabilities

### Ad Format Limitations
- **Basic format support**: Supports HTML, banner (responsive images), and native formats (no video, audio, interactive)
- **Simple native ads**: Basic JSON structure without standardized templates
- **No creative validation**: No automated scanning for malicious or policy-violating content

### Campaign Management
- **Limited budget pacing**: Line items have dual-counter pacing system but use simpler algorithms than commercial systems
- **Manual optimization**: No automatic bid adjustments or optimization

### Data & Privacy
- **No consent management**: Missing GDPR/CCPA compliance features
- **Limited data protection**: No PII anonymization or data retention policies
- **No identity resolution**: Cannot link users across devices or sessions

## Scale Limitations

| Component | Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Throughput** | ~2,000-3,000 QPS max | Single instance, memory-bound |
| **Scaling** | Vertical only | Cannot distribute campaign data horizontally |
| **Geographic** | Single-region deployment | No multi-region support |
| **Creative Assets** | No CDN integration | Limited to small files served locally |
| **PostgreSQL** | Single instance only | Database limited to vertical scaling |
| **ClickHouse** | Single node only | Analytics capacity tied to one machine |
| **Redis** | Memory-bounded | Operational data limited by available RAM |
| **Logs** | No rotation/archival | Manual log management required |

## Strengths Despite Limitations

While this document focuses on limitations, this ad server provides:
- **Clean, readable codebase** for learning and customization
- **Publisher-first design** with flexibility prioritized over scale
- **Comprehensive documentation** with working examples
- **Modern observability** using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry
- **Real ad tech concepts** correctly implemented
- **Extensible architecture** allowing gradual enhancement

This implementation serves as an educational resource and foundation for small to medium-scale ad serving needs.
